            <h1>Murang'a county government History & Governance</h1>
            <p>Murang’a County, located in central Kenya, is historically known as the cradle of the Kikuyu community. It played a vital role in Kenya’s independence struggle, producing notable Mau Mau fighters. Formerly part of Central Province, Murang’a became a county under the 2010 Constitution. The county is governed by a devolved system led by a Governor, County Assembly, and executive committee. It is divided into several sub-counties, each managed by a sub-county administrator. The governance system aims to bring services closer to the people, promote development, and ensure citizen participation in decision-making. Murang’a’s economy relies on agriculture, especially tea and coffee.
